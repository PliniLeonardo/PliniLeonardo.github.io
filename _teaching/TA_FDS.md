I worked as a Teaching Assistant for the course “Fundamentals of Data Science” offered in the Master Degrees in Data Science and Computer Science (Sapienza University of Rome) under the supervision of Professor Fabio Galasso. I was responsible for the development of the projects assigned during the course and I supported the teaching activity.
