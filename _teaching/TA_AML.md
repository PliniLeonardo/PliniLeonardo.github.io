I worked as a Teaching Assistant for the course “Advanced Machine Learning” offered in the Master Degrees in Data Science and Computer Science (Sapienza University of Rome) under the supervision of Professor Fabio Galasso. I was responsible for the development of the projects assigned during the course and I supported the teaching activity with lectures. -->
