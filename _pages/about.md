👨‍💻 I am first year PhD student in [Artificial Intelligence](https://phd.uniroma1.it/web/ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE_nD3764_EN.aspx) at [Sapienza University of Rome](https://www.uniroma1.it/en/pagina-strutturale/home) and [INFN-LNF](https://w3.lnf.infn.it/?lang=en)

🛑 I am currently working on mistake and anomaly detection at PINlab, focusing on the use of Egocentric data and Large Language Models (LLMs). My research involves developing methods to identify and address errors and anomalies in data collected from a first-person perspective, leveraging the capabilities of LLMs to enhance the analysis and interpretation of this data. This work aims to improve the reliability and accuracy of detection systems in real-world applications.

⚛️ My current focus is on applying machine learning techniques to challenges in particle physics, specifically within the NA62 collaboration. As part of this project, I am working on the development of advanced algorithms designed to track the trajectories of particles as they move through detectors. This work aims to leverage machine learning to enhance the precision and efficiency of particle tracking, contributing to the broader goals of the NA62 experiment in studying rare particle interactions.
